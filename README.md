**How to Set Up a Private Network on AWS: A Comprehensive Guide.**
The procedures for setting up a scalable and safe private network on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host your PostgreSQL database and web application are described in this article.

1. Use the AWS Management Console to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
A virtual private cloud (VPC) separates your network resources from the open internet, giving your application a safe and secure environment.
Establish your VPC's CIDR block (address range). The quantity of IP addresses that are available for your resources is determined by this.

2. To divide your network, define subnets inside your VPC:
Your VPC is divided into smaller logical networks by subnets.
For web servers, you may make public subnets that are connected to the internet, and private subnets that are used just for resources like your database.

3. Set up routing tables to control traffic flow inside your VPC. Routing tables specify the direction of traffic flow inside your VPC.
To guarantee connectivity between resources inside the VPC and (optionally) the internet gateway for public subnets, associate subnets with routing tables and configure routes.

4. Start your web application server or servers by launching Amazon EC2 instances:
You may launch your web application on cloud virtual servers called EC2 instances.
Based on the specifications (CPU, RAM, etc.) of your application, select the proper instance type.
For security, start instances in a private subnet.

5. Start more EC2 instances for your PostgreSQL database server(s): 
PostgreSQL is a well-liked relational database management system that is available as an open source project.
Start up dedicated EC2 instances on a private subnet for your database server or servers.

6. Install and setup the application by establishing an SSH connection to your web application instance:
Your EC2 instances may be accessed securely from a distance with Secure Shell (SSH).
Installing the required drivers and configurations for your application to function may be done by connecting to your web application instance via SSH.

7. Install and setup the database by establishing an SSH connection to your PostgreSQL instance:
Use SSH to log into your PostgreSQL instance.
Install and set up PostgreSQL based on the database requirements of your application.

8. Set up the PostgreSQL database connection for your web application:
For your web application to connect to the PostgreSQL database instance, update its settings.
This entails providing the hostname, port, login, and password for the database server.

9. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to split traffic across the instances of your web applications:
For redundancy and scalability, an ALB splits incoming traffic among many active web application instances.
Use an internal listener and target group to configure the ALB to route traffic to your web server instances within the private subnet.

10. To manage traffic flow, use security groups and network access control lists (NACLs):
For your EC2 instances, security groups function as firewalls, managing both incoming and outgoing traffic.
Give your instances access to only the traffic that is required (e.g., HTTP traffic for the web server).
NACLs offer further protection by regulating traffic flow at the subnet level.

11. If you want secure access to your private network resources, you may also establish a bastion server in a public subnet:
A bastion host serves as a gateway for safely connecting from the internet to resources within your private network.
Establish a bastion host with limited incoming traffic restrictions (such as SSH access from particular IP addresses) in a public network.
For administrative duties, you can then establish an SSH connection through the bastion host to your web application or database instances.

Extra Points to Remember: 
This is just a broad summary. Depending on the requirements of your application, certain parameters may change.
Make sure you adhere to security best practices, such as using secure passwords and implementing access controls.
For infrastructure as code management, take into consideration automated configuration management technologies such as AWS CloudFormation.
By carrying out these actions, you can
